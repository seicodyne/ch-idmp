#### Changed / Updated
- Changed hl7.terminology.r5 version to 7.0.1
- Changed hl7.terminology.r5 version to 7.0.0
- Changed hl7.terminology.r5 version to 6.5.0
- Graphic of the business datamodel & datatable
- Hide documentation for authorised medicinal product as this information is under revision at Swissmedic.
- Alignment and translated the example product descriptions.
- Removal of the attribute "Disease Status", as Swissmedic has not yet defined a value list for this element.  

#### Update
- New example product Abrilada containing 2 pack sizes plus 7 limitations to illustrate multiple pack sizes and multiple limitations.

#### Changes in the datatable
Change comment: Even when the datamodel indicates the cardinalities vice versa, in FHIR the pointer direction in the FHIR structure is in oposition to the pointer direction in the business data model. Hence, the business datamodel indicates 1..* packaged medicinal products pointing to 0..1 Reimbursement Authorisations each. But in the FHIR structure a Reimbursement instance is created, and the Reimbursement instance is pointing to the related Packaged Medicinal Product. This is the reason for the reversed cardinality.
